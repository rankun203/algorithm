=========
The textbook is organized into six chapters: 

<ul>
<li> <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/10fundamentals"><em>Chapter 1: Fundamentals</em></a>
introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms
and making predictions. It also includes our programming model.

<li> <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/20sorting"><em>Chapter 2: Sorting</em></a>
considers several classic sorting algorithms, including 
insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also includes a binary
heap implementation of a priority queue.

<li> <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/30searching"><em>Chapter 3: Searching</em></a>
describes several classic symbol table implementations, including 
binary search trees, red-black trees, and hash tables.

<li> <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/40graphs"><em>Chapter 4: Graphs</em></a>
surveys the most important graph processing problems, including
depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees,
and shortest paths.

<li> <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/50strings"><em>Chapter 5: Strings</em></a>
investigates specialized algorithms for string processing,
including radix sorting, substring search, tries,
regular expressions, and data compression.

<li> <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/60context"><em>Chapter 6: Context</em></a>
highlights connections to 
systems programming, scientific computing, commercial applications,
operations research, and intractability.

</ul>

==========
Our original goal for this book was to cover
<em>the 50 algorithms that every programmer should know.</em>
We use the word <em>programmer</em> to refer to anyone engaged in trying to accomplish 
something with the help of a computer, including scientists, engineers, and applications 
developers, not to mention college students in science, engineering, and computer science.

<p><b>Algorithms and clients in the textbook.</b><br>
The list below includes a few more than 100 Java programs (some are clients,
some others are basic infrastructure).
Click on the program name to access the Java code; click on the description to 
access the javadoc; click on the data file names to access the data.
You can download all of the programs as <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar"><b>algs4.jar</b></a><sup><a href="#ref">[1]</a></sup> and
the data as <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4-data.zip"><b>algs4-data.zip<b></a>.
